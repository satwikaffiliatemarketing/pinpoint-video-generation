### PROMPT FOR GOOGLE ANTIGRAVITY AI: LINKEDIN PINPOINT AUTOMATION

**Objective:**
Create a daily automated video generation and YouTube upload workflow for the LinkedIn Pinpoint game

**1. Technical Architecture:**
- **Language:** Python
- **Browser Automation:** Playwright (sync API) with native video recording enabled. see strucute of the site @link
- **Video Editing:** MoviePy (to add intro/outro).
- **Hosting/Upload:** GitHub Actions for daily execution + YouTube Data API v3 for uploading.

**2. Core Logic:**
for first 2-3 attampts it will gemini to api to get answer and at last attampt it will type the exact answer 
- **Answer Fetching:** Fetch the daily answer and clues from this API: `https://linkedin-pinpoint-worker.gdgdughdshf.workers.dev/today/BloggingIo@7`
- **Response Format:**
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "number": 621,
      "date": "2026-01-11",
      "clues": ["Clue 1", "Clue 2", ...],
      "answer": "Correct Answer"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Bot Detection Bypass:** 
  - Use human-like typing (random delays between keystrokes 0.1s - 0.4s).
  - Add random pauses (2-5 seconds) before and after interacting with buttons.
  - Implement stealth measures to hide `navigator.webdriver`.

**3. Gameplay Interaction:**
- The script should visit the LinkedIn Pinpoint game URL.
- use gemini to get new posible thing 
- Use the clues and answers from the API to play the game correctly.
- No "solver" algorithm is needed; just use the provided API data to complete the game visual steps.

**4. Video Production:**

- **Recording:** Record the whole browser session at 1920x1080 resolution.
- **Format:** Convert the final video to `.mp4`.

**5. YouTube SEO & Upload:**
- **Schedule:** Run daily via GitHub Actions at 18:32 UTC (00:02 IST).
- **Date Logic:** Use strict IST (UTC+5:30) to determine the date for the title and description.
- **Metadata Protection:** NEVER mention "automation" or "bot" in the title/description. It must look like manual, professional gameplay.
- **Title Example:** `LinkedIn Pinpoint [Formatted Date] Answer | Today's Pinpoint Hints & Key`
- **Description:** Include a link to `WordSolverX.com/pinpoint-solver`, describe the game steps for SEO, and include relevant hashtags.

**6. Deployment:**
- Provide a `requirements.txt` with `playwright`, `requests`, `moviepy`, `google-api-python-client`, etc.
- Provide a GitHub Actions YAML file that installs Playwright, the Chromium browser, and necessary dependencies.
